# Evolution Simulator

By Aiden Wilson, Dennis Mironov, and Callum Irving.

Evolution Simulator is an artificial life simulation written in Processing. It
goes through the experience of a certain specimen scrounging for food and the
evolution of a life form to help survive in various environments. The program
will display a miniature world that will show tiny creatures moving about
looking for food. It shows the difference in one's genetics and how it affects
the creature's survivability; some of these genes include the radius in which
they are able to sense food, how fast they are and the size of the creature.
Users can also customize the energy demand for each individual trait that a
creature possesses. These parameters along with other features such as
predation will affect how the creatures evolve over time in order to find the
optimal way to survive.
